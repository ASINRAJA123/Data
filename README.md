# AI-Powered Data Insights Dashboard

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload a dataset (CSV/Excel), and automatically generates an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and an AI-powered executive summary using Google's Gemini API. It also features a chatbot to ask natural language questions about the data.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Drag-and-drop or browse to upload CSV or Excel files.
- **Automated Data Cleaning:** Handles basic data type conversion and missing value imputation.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:**
    - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    - Interactive charts powered by Plotly.
    - AI-generated executive summary.
- **Conversational AI Chatbot:** Ask questions in plain English (e.g., "What were the total sales?") and get answers directly from your data.
- **PDF Export:** Generate and download a professional PDF report of the entire dashboard.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with FastAPI (Python) on the backend and modern vanilla JS on the frontend.

## ⚠️ Security Warning ⚠️

The chatbot feature uses `eval()` to execute Python code generated by the LLM. **This is extremely dangerous and should NEVER be used in a public-facing production environment**, as it can allow for arbitrary code execution on your server. This implementation is for demonstration purposes in a controlled environment only. For production, use a sandboxed execution environment or a safer query-building library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ and `pip`
- A Google Gemini API Key

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ai_dashboard_project
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    - Create a virtual environment (recommended):
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```
    - Install the required Python packages:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file from the example and add your API key:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      # Now open .env and paste your Gemini API key
      ```

## How to Run

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - Make sure you are in the `backend` directory with your virtual environment activated.
    - Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
      ```bash
      uvicorn app:app --reload
      ```
    - The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Launch the Frontend:**
    - Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser. You can usually just double-click it.
    - **Note:** For some browser security features, it's better to serve the frontend via a simple local server. If you have Python installed, you can do this easily:
      - Open a **new terminal window**.
      - Navigate to the project's root directory (`ai_dashboard_project`).
      - Run: `python -m http.server 3000`
      - Then open `http://localhost:3000/frontend/` in your browser.

3.  **Use the Application:**
    - Drag and drop your sample data CSV/Excel file into the upload area.
    - The dashboard will automatically generate and appear.
    - Use the chatbot widget to ask questions.
    - Click "Export to PDF" to download the report.
